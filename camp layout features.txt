_____________________________ Objects _____________________________
-make object move independently or by selection group on the canvas
-potentially rethink the snapping system, instead of a fixed grid snap, object snap onto each other,
based on minimum distances from OBJECT_TEMPLATE
-make all objects rotatable
-add:
	exterior lighting units
	fire points
	antennas
- allow object editing:
	change object name
	change object power rating
	


_____________________________ Cables _____________________________
-rework the cable system, only activate after a button has been pressed
-rework the snapping point system:
	invisible unless mouse if hovering the object, and cable placement is active
	when mouse hovers object, show all connection points at once, on a small scale
	when a single connection point is hovered, make it 4x bigger, and modulate it lighter
-link cables so generators are parents to distribution boxes, which are parent to loads in the data struct

_____________________________ dual version system _____________________________
Develop a dual system, one for fast object placement, and list retrieval, the other expands
that for precise power assignements, object can be drawned inside a tent object, and preset power values
are set to those items ( printers, laptops, routers, shredders, lighting)

_____________________________ Console _____________________________
show every action (from now on) in the console, located inside cc_canvas

_____________________________ Bug fixes _____________________________
Canvas scaling:
	- make the snapping consistent across all zoom levels
		currently, the snapping precision changes depending on zoom, which is terrible
	- make zooming centered about the mouse cursor, not the origin
